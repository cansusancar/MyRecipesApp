This project is written with Kotlin programming language in Android Studio. It is an android recipes application that demonstrates a Clean Architecture with MVVM and Dependency Injection with Dagger-Hilt ,  uses Android Architecture Components such as LiveData, ViewModel, Navigation, Lifecycle, DataBinding,  RecyclerView, ConstraintLayout, idiomatic Kotlin using extension functions and much more which are new and good practices recommended by Google (especially Jetpack Components). In addition to these, I used Retrofit library to fetch data from a certain API, SharedPreferences to store data locally, Lottie Animation, Navigation Drawer, Battom Navigation Bar, ScrollView and more to visually improve user experience.
